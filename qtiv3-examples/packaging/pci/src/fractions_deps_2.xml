      Mary is saving to buy a birthday present for her mother. 
      Every week she counts the money she has saved into piles of $5. 
      At the end of the first week Mary had saved $10 and was planning to
      buy her mother a present worth $30.
      <p> </p>
      She represented this in the following shaded chart with a shaded square
      for every $5 saved and a target of $30.
      <p> </p>

      <p>By the second week she has already saved the exact amount she planned 
      on spending on the present ($30) and is trying to work out if she will be able
      to afford a more expensive present costing $45.</p>
      <p>To help her do this use the buttons below to create a chart representing
      $45 assuming that each square represents $5 and then click to shade the 
      fraction of the chart representing the amount saved in two weeks.</p>
