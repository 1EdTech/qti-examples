            <qti-prompt>Studies of people with brain damage show that people will rationalize their behavior
                after it has occurred; making up reasons that they claim 'caused' the behavior. This has
                profound impllications for the concept of free will and the mind-body problem. Do we have any
                control over our actions or are we simply responding to stimuli and justifying our
                responses?</qti-prompt>

        <qti-content-body>Customer relationship management is the overall process of building and 
            maintaining profitable customer relationships by delivering superior customer value and satisfaction.
            Said another way, it is about developing long-term, mutually beneficial relationships. 
            Modern marketers are going beyond designing strategies to attract new customers 
            and create transactions with them. They are using customer relationship management 
            to retain current customers and build long-term relationships with them. 
            This new view is that marketing is the science and art of finding, growing and
            retaining profitable customers. The key to building lasting customer relationships is to create
            superior customer value and satisfaction. Customer perceived value is the difference between total
            customer value and total customer cost, whereas customer satisfaction is the extent to which a
            product's perceived performance matches a buyer's expectations.
