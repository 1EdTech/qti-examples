		<p>Lorna is flying back home to the UK. Ideally, she would like to fly in directly to her
			home town of Glasgow. Edinburgh is her second choice and, if necessary, she could fly
			into London and pick up an internal connecting flight. Although she has been offered a
			cheap flight to Manchester it remains her least favourite option as connecting flights
			to Glasgow are not very reliable from there.</p>
