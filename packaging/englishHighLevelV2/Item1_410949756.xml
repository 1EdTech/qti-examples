		<p>Europe is  no  longer  the  United StatesÂ´  chief  supplier of <br/>
		immigrants. The lead passed to Asia and Latin America in the 1960s, <br/>
		and by the next decade their arrivals were  outnumbering those from <br/>
		the  Old World  by four to one.  Nationwide they  still  comprise a <br/>
		small  minority,  yet they  also  have  changed the  ethic mix of a <br/>
		half-dozen  and more  major metropolitan  centers.  Although an ex- <br/>
		treme case,  Greater Los Angeles  exemplifies  the  forces at work. <br/>
		Ist Hispanic presence has  increased threefold  and ist  Asian ten- <br/>
		fold over the last twenty-five years.</p>
		<p>More immigrants, and more different kinds of immigrants, have <br/>
		entered the United States than any other country in modern history. <br/>
		The conditions  that  led  them  to leave  their  homelands varied: <br/>
		overpopulation,  contracting economic  opportunities,  famine, war, <br/>
		religious  persecution,  political  oppression.  Whatever  the push <br/>
		that set them in motion,  the pull that  lured them  to America was <br/>
		the promise of  a fresh start.  Much the  same reasons  explain why <br/>
		newcomers  are still  coming,  close to  four million  in  the last <br/>
		decade,  not counting  an unknown  but doubtlessly  large number of <br/>
		illegal entrants<sup>1</sup>.</p>
