        <p>A chocolate factory produces several types of chocolate, some of which have nut centres.
            The chocolates are mixed together and are randomly packed into cartons of ten.</p>
        <qti-upload-interaction response-identifier="RESPONSE">
            <qti-prompt>Build a spreadsheet to simulate 50 cartons of chocolates when each carton
                contains 10 chocolates, and when one-seventh of the chocolates have nut centres.
                Your spreadsheet should include 50 rows representing the 50 cartons, each row
                containing 10 columns to represent the chocolates.</qti-prompt>
