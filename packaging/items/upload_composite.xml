        <p>A chocolate factory produces several types of chocolate, some of which have nut centres.
            The chocolates are mixed together and are randomly packed into cartons of ten.</p>
        <qti-upload-interaction response-identifier="RESPONSE">
            <qti-prompt>Build a spreadsheet to simulate 50 cartons of chocolates when each carton
                contains 10 chocolates, and when one-seventh of the chocolates have nut centres.
                Your spreadsheet should include 50 rows representing the 50 cartons, each row
                containing 10 columns to represent the chocolates.</qti-prompt>
        </qti-upload-interaction>
        <p>Incorporate in your spreadsheet a count of how many cartons contain fewer than two nut
            centres, and hence estimate (to the nearest whole number) the percentage of a cartons
            containing fewer than two nut centres: <qti-text-entry-interaction response-identifier="RESPONSE_P" expected-length="3"/>%</p>
